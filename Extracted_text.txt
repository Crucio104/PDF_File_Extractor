Exercise 3 Given the function
f(x)=3p
3+x1
1. ﬁnd the domain of f, symmetries and study the sign of f;
2. ﬁnd the continuity and di erentiability set and precise the type of discontinuities and non-di erentiability points (if
there exist), asymptotes;
3. ﬁnd maximum, minimum and ﬂex points (if there exist);
4. intervals of monotonicity of the function fand the derivative f0, intervals of convexity and concavity;
5. draw the rough graph.
